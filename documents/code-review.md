For my code-review, I looked at lucasrocmoreira's iGenome project; kuratanp's mlclusters project; and vjjan91's web-scraping project.

1. In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?

Lucas's readme was extremely clear and concise. The project was described in detail. Installation and CLI usage was laid out very well and the picture of the pipeline was a great touch.

Kuratanp's readme was also very clear and consise. The basics of the project along with installation and usage were very clear from the readme.

vjjan91's project also had a very good readme. The project is described in detail. Installation and usage are explained in the notebooks, as per the goal of the project.

2. Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?

Lucas's project had .py scripts in a project folder; furthermore, it was customized for CLI and API usage, with init and main files added. The code was organized in class structures and looked good.

Kuratanp's project also looked good. it contained a .py file for the main code along with an init file for API usage. the code was organized in class structure.

Vjjan91's project did not warrant the creation of a project folder, and instead the code was contained within a notebook. 


3. Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?

Lucas provided an example notebook in the notebooks directory. This was a clear and consise example usage of the first step of the iGenomics tool.

Kurantap provided a number of notebooks, including one with simulated data which illustrated the utility of her project's approach.

Vjjan91's notebooks folder was the center of his project. There are three notebooks which illustrate the web-scraping and online data mining approach of his project.

4. Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?

Yes, I came up with many great ideas for my own project by looking at these three github repos! Namely, I got ideas about readme description, directory organization and general presentation.
